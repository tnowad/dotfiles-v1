# Tnowad's dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring Qtile, Kitty,
Rofi, and Fish Shell. These dotfiles are tailored to my workflow and preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use these dotfiles, ensure that you have the following
prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/)
- [Kitty Terminal Emulator](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/)

## Installation

To use my dotfiles, you can clone this repository to your home directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tnowad/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

Once cloned, you can symlink the dotfiles to their respective locations in your
home directory. This can usually be done with a script or by manually creating symlinks.

Example:

```bash
ln -s /home/tnowad/dotfiles/.config/fish /home/tnowad/.config/
```
